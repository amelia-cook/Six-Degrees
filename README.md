# Six-Degrees
This is a graph representing the six degrees of separation between given artists through their songs. It features BFS and DFS searches, and can find connections excluding certain artists as well.

Because this was a class-project, and due to Tufts University policy, the code cannot be made public. It is available upon request.

Thanks! Amelia
